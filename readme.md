## About Trello Client

Hi and welcome to Trello Client, where you could connect all your trello accounts, because we know that you have a trello account for work, another one for studies and more.
So we wanted to make things easier for you, and with this app you could use all of them at the same time, great, right?

## How do I use it ? 
Easy my friend, we will guide you with this steps so you will not be lost

- Register, you just need a username and a password, that's all, no confirmation mail
- Login and go to 'Add Trello Account'
- Wait for the pop-up, confirm you want to give access, add a name so you will now what account it is, later
- Go to Accounts, and your new account must be there, click on 'See Boards' and that's all

## Warning

If you are a developer and you want to run this project, or the tests you should consider this in your .env file

- You should set a variable called "TRELLO_KEY" with your developer key from TRELLO
- If you want to run the tests, you should set a variable called "TRELLO_ACCOUNT_KEY" with a key from an active account. But be careful, because the tests will delete it everything from the account.
